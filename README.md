# TaxiFareCalculator
This is a react native mobile app that's used to calculate change in south african taxis where there's a lot of people in a minibus.

# What Needs To Be Added
The app working fine by I'd like it better if it had a custom keyboard that has money amounts such as R5, R10, R20, R50, R100 and R200 
so that it can be easier to calculate. 
Landscape mode needs to be disabled on the app as well. I plan to do the above, however if you feel like it you are free to do it yourself
